# Searching Contents in a Distributed Application-Layer Network

A simple overlay-based solution allows a set of nodes to share resources among each other. A set of nodes are connected via overlay topology and each node tries to share some files with other nodes. Thus, a node issues a query in order to identify a node and thus node can be identified and help in sharing files successfully. This code develops a solution for searching contents in a distributed system. Main goal is to generate network topology and design search algortihms in order to locate contents in a distributed system.
